### <div align="center">Project Overview</div>
I collected nest data from Common Grackle colonies in central Illinois in 2018 and 2019 to answer questions about nest success and net productivity. The species is declining rapidly in Illinois and it was hypothesized that low reproductive success was the cause. I used a logistic exposure model with a binomial distribution to estimate nest daily survival rate and the probablity of nest success. I also included two covariates in the model, seasonality and clutch size. I found a nest success rate of 62% from a sample of 188 nests and found that seasonality had a significant influence on nest success (Figure 1). I also found that nest success in my study was significantly higher than the literature average (using a weighted t-test) suggesting that low reproductive success is not driving population decline in Illinois. Population modeling done later in my thesis suggested that non-breeding survival, particularly on the wintering grounds, is most likely responsible for Common Grackle decline.<br/>
